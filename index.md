## Cash IQ

Welcome to CashIQ. 

Cash IQ allows parents to set chores for their children to complete, rewarding them with in-app coins as they do finish their chores. Children can redeem these coins by creating wishlists with items they want. Parents can set prices for these items which the children can redeem using their hard earned coins. 

Cash IQ aims to teach young children the importance of money and to teach them to make better financial descisions.
